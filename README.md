# Simple MQTT Client

This Node project will act as an MQTT client. It will send every 10s the battery level to the HiveMQ public broker.

This client is used in a tutorial article about InfluxDB, Telegraf and MQTT to set up a real MQTT example just with your laptop!

## Getting Started

To run the client:

```
npm install
npm start
```
